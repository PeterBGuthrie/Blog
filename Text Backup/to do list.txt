Questions
===============================================================================
Target migration information How does it work for updating DB
	Changed the name of a role in my seed. Is this where I would apply this change.

Valid method. Grabbing code from Devtools that was created by Razer and dropping that in instead of the razer code to carve templete elements.

What is #region native to?

Scss Where does it go so my program can properly link to it.

// Do I have these three parts of MVC correct as I understand them.
The Model is liteally our model it informs the program and the DB what our data looks like or things that are data require.
The controller takes data as laid out by the model and manipulates it. It communicates data to a view via a HttpGet that is understood and recives data via a HttpPost. Variables can be gained progromatically or via the view and a HttpPost in this part of the model.
The view works with the final assembly and display of data, It dypically does not modify data but it can organize data provided by a Contoller through several tools. Data modifyed on a view can than be pushed to a controller action via a HttpPost. The view is also where all of our navigation between differnet views is handeled.

@model IEnumerable<Blog.Models.Comment>
Says in this view the model of data we will be using is. The one in the Blog which is the name of the project, the models for that blog, and the comment model listed in the models. And IEnumberable says we should expect form the controller many of this model type.

// Not sure what these terms are attached to.
Class definition. Class Level Is blogposts contoller an instance of a class ?
Name space.

Remove http: from online CSS libraries Why ?

Vissual studio References how to get ride of it.

missed 20 and 21st


Local debuggin verses online switching DB's. Making sure I know what version I am running.
Also I switched the DB to link locally in the web.config. I think.
(Note for Future me: Yes I know all the fonst are broken or in the wrong file I stopped working on it for reason listed above and making sleep related errors)

Fixing this issue in git before push.
